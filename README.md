# Langgraph Welcome My Friends In Style.
My friends are visiting from Europe to India. Since we all studied together in the same university and took the same courses, I would say we're a bit tech-savvy. While being a good host is one way to welcome them, I also want to introduce them to all that India has to offer. Additionally, I'm keen on experimenting with the power of AI and showcasing how it can be used for human development. 
I believe this example will demonstrate how AI can be utilized for good. Hence, I plan to create a state-machine that encapsulates the essence of the entire trip for my friends. Although there's room for improvement, I believe the start isn't too shabby either.

## State Machine
